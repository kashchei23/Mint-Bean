## How to Play

Mint Match is based on the classic card matching game known as Concentration, sometimes called Matching Pairs, Match Match, Match Up, and Memory.

<br />

- The single player game is played by laying matching pairs of cards face down on a surface.
- Two cards are flipped face up on each turn.
- Matching cards are removed from the board, while non-matching cards are flipped face down for the player to try again.
- The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards until the board is clear!
